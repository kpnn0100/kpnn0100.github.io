  story:
    "After a long journey of writing music, I’ve finally gained confidence in my lyrics. This EP is my way of proving to myself that I can truly make good music. Sugary Side is the track I love the most, from its concept to its final presentation. With this song, I can finally say to my 15-year-old self, \"We made it.\"",
